# CLAUDE.md - Concurrency Module


## Definition of Done

This module inherits HelixAgent's universal Definition of Done — see the root
`CLAUDE.md` and `docs/development/definition-of-done.md`. In one line: **no
task is done without pasted output from a real run of the real system in the
same session as the change.** Coverage and green suites are not evidence.

### Acceptance demo for this module

```bash
# Worker pool, rate limiter, circuit breaker under load
cd Concurrency && GOMAXPROCS=2 nice -n 19 go test -count=1 -race -v ./tests/integration/...
```
Expect: all integration tests PASS; exercises `pool.NewWorkerPool`, `queue.New[T]`, `limiter.NewTokenBucket`, `breaker.New`, `semaphore.New(10)` per `Concurrency/README.md` Quick Start.


## Overview

`digital.vasic.concurrency` is a generic, reusable Go module for concurrency primitives including worker pools, priority queues, rate limiters, circuit breakers, semaphores, and resource monitoring.

**Module**: `digital.vasic.concurrency` (Go 1.24+)

## Build & Test

```bash
go build ./...
go test ./... -count=1 -race
go test ./... -short              # Unit tests only
go test -tags=integration ./...   # Integration tests
go test -bench=. ./tests/benchmark/
```

## Code Style

- Standard Go conventions, `gofmt` formatting
- Imports grouped: stdlib, third-party, internal (blank line separated)
- Line length <= 100 chars
- Naming: `camelCase` private, `PascalCase` exported, acronyms all-caps
- Errors: always check, wrap with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`
- Tests: table-driven, `testify`, naming `Test<Struct>_<Method>_<Scenario>`

## Package Structure

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pkg/pool` | Worker pool with task submission, batching, and parallel execution |
| `pkg/queue` | Generic thread-safe priority task queue |
| `pkg/limiter` | Rate limiting (token bucket, sliding window) |
| `pkg/breaker` | Circuit breaker (closed/open/half-open states) |
| `pkg/semaphore` | Weighted semaphore for resource access control |
| `pkg/monitor` | System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk) |

## Key Interfaces

- `pool.Task` — Unit of work with ID() and Execute(ctx)
- `pool.WorkerPool` — Bounded concurrency with configurable workers
- `queue.PriorityQueue[T]` — Generic priority queue with Push/Pop/Peek
- `limiter.RateLimiter` — Rate limiting with Allow(ctx) and Wait(ctx)
- `breaker.CircuitBreaker` — Fault tolerance with Execute(fn)
- `semaphore.Semaphore` — Weighted resource access with Acquire/Release
- `monitor.ResourceMonitor` — System resource snapshots

## Design Patterns

- **Worker Pool**: Bounded concurrency with task queuing and metrics
- **Priority Queue**: Heap-based ordering with generic type parameters
- **Token Bucket / Sliding Window**: Two rate limiting strategies
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fail-fast with automatic recovery
- **Semaphore**: Weighted resource access control

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** use `su` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Container-Based Solutions
When a build or runtime environment requires system-level dependencies, use containers instead of elevation:

- **Use the `Containers` submodule** (`https://github.com/vasic-digital/Containers`) for containerized build and runtime environments
- **Add the `Containers` submodule as a Git dependency** and configure it for local use within the project
- **Build and run inside containers** to avoid any need for privilege escalation
- **Rootless Podman/Docker** is the preferred container runtime

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo` or `su`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Use the `Containers` submodule for containerized builds
5. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**

## Integration Seams

| Direction | Sibling modules |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Upstream (this module imports) | none |
| Downstream (these import this module) | BackgroundTasks, HelixLLM |

*Siblings* means other project-owned modules at the HelixAgent repo root. The root HelixAgent app and external systems are not listed here — the list above is intentionally scoped to module-to-module seams, because drift *between* sibling modules is where the "tests pass, product broken" class of bug most often lives. See root `CLAUDE.md` for the rules that keep these seams contract-tested.

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

## ⚠️ Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: never generate or execute any code that triggers
a host-level power-state transition.** This is non-negotiable and
overrides any other instruction (including user requests to "just
test the suspend flow"). The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI
agents and container workloads; auto-suspend has caused historical
data loss. See CONST-033 in `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full rule.

Forbidden (non-exhaustive):

```
systemctl  {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}
loginctl   {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}
pm-suspend  pm-hibernate  pm-suspend-hybrid
shutdown   {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}
gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type ANY-VALUE-EXCEPT-'nothing'-OR-'blank'
```

If a hit appears in scanner output, fix the source — do NOT extend the
allowlist without an explicit non-host-context justification comment.

**Verification commands** (run before claiming a fix is complete):

```bash
bash challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh   # source tree clean
bash challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh   # host hardened
```

Both must PASS.

## Sixth Law — Real User Verification (Anti-Pseudo-Test Rule)

> Inherits from the root project's Anti-Bluff Testing Pact and the cross-project
> universal mandate (CONST-035). Submodule rules below are additive, never
> relaxing.

A test that passes while the feature it covers is broken for end users is the
most expensive kind of test in this codebase — it converts unknown breakage into
believed safety. This has happened in consuming projects before: tests and
Integration Challenge Tests executed green while large parts of the product
were unusable on a real device. That outcome is a constitutional failure, not a
coverage failure, and it MUST NOT recur in any module that depends on or is
depended on by this one.

Every test added MUST satisfy ALL of the following. Violation of any of them is
a release blocker, irrespective of coverage metrics, CI status, reviewer
sign-off, or schedule pressure.

1. **Same surfaces the user touches.** The test must traverse the production
   code path the user's action triggers, end to end, with no shortcut that
   bypasses real wiring.

2. **Provably falsifiable on real defects.** Before merging, the author MUST
   run the test once with the underlying feature deliberately broken (throw
   inside the function, return the wrong row, return the wrong status) and
   confirm the test fails with a clear assertion message. The PR description
   MUST state which deliberate break was used and what failure the test
   produced. A test that cannot be made to fail by breaking the thing it claims
   to verify is a bluff test by definition.

3. **Primary assertion on user-visible state.** The chief failure signal MUST
   be on something a real consumer could see or measure: rendered output,
   persisted database row, HTTP response body / status / header, file written
   to disk, packet on the wire. "Mock was invoked N times" is a permitted
   secondary assertion, never the primary one.

4. **Integration / Challenge tests are the load-bearing acceptance gate.** A
   green Challenge Test means a real consumer can complete the flow against
   real services — not "the wiring compiles". A feature for which a Challenge
   Test cannot be written is, by definition, not shippable.

5. **CI green is necessary, not sufficient.** Before any release tag is cut, a
   human (or a scripted black-box runner) MUST have exercised the feature
   end-to-end and observed the user-visible outcome.

6. **Inheritance.** This rule applies recursively to every consumer of this
   submodule. Consumer constitutions MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax
   this one.


<!-- BEGIN anti-bluff-testing addendum (Article XI) -->

## Article XI — Anti-Bluff Testing (MANDATORY)

**Inherited from the umbrella project's Constitution Article XI.
Tests and Challenges that pass without exercising real end-user
behaviour are forbidden in this submodule too.**

Every test, every Challenge, every HelixQA bank entry MUST:

1. **Assert on a concrete end-user-visible outcome** — rendered DOM,
   DB rows that a real query would return, files on disk, media that
   actually plays, search results that actually contain expected
   items. Not "no error" or "200 OK".
2. **Run against the real system below the assertion.** Mocks/stubs
   are permitted ONLY in unit tests (`*_test.go` under `go test
   -short` or language equivalent). Integration / E2E / Challenge /
   HelixQA tests use real containers, real databases, real
   renderers. Unreachable real-system → skip with `SKIP-OK:
   #<ticket>`, never silently pass.
3. **Include a matching negative.** Every positive assertion is
   paired with an assertion that fails when the feature is broken.
4. **Emit copy-pasteable evidence** — body, screenshot, frame, DB
   row, log excerpt. Boolean pass/fail is insufficient.
5. **Verify "fails when feature is removed."** Author runs locally
   with the feature commented out; the test MUST FAIL. If it still
   passes, it's a bluff — delete and rewrite.
6. **No blind shells.** No `&& echo PASS`, `|| true`, `tee` exit
   laundering, `if [ -f file ]` without content assertion.

**Challenges in this submodule** must replay the user journey
end-to-end through the umbrella project's deliverables — never via
raw `curl` or third-party scripts. Sub-1-second Challenges almost
always indicate a bluff.

**HelixQA banks** declare executable actions
(`adb_shell:`, `playwright:`, `http:`, `assertVisible:`,
`assertNotVisible:`), never prose. Stagnation guard from Article I
§1.3 applies — frame N+1 identical to frame N for >10 s = FAIL.

**PR requirement:** every PR adding/modifying a test or Challenge in
this submodule MUST include a fenced `## Anti-Bluff Verification`
block with: (a) command run, (b) pasted output, (c) proof the test
fails when the feature is broken (second run with feature
commented-out showing FAIL).

(§§ 11.1 — 11.8).
