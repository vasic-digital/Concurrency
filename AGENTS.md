# AGENTS.md - Multi-Agent Coordination Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidance for AI agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) working with the `digital.vasic.concurrency` module. It describes conventions, coordination patterns, and boundaries that agents must respect.

## Module Identity

- **Module path**: `digital.vasic.concurrency`
- **Language**: Go 1.24+
- **Dependencies**: `github.com/shirou/gopsutil/v3` (monitor), `github.com/stretchr/testify` (tests)
- **Scope**: Generic, reusable concurrency primitives. No application-specific logic.

## Package Responsibilities

| Package | Owner Concern | Agent Must Not |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| `pkg/pool` | Worker pool lifecycle, task execution, metrics | Add provider-specific logic |
| `pkg/queue` | Priority ordering, generic type safety | Break heap invariants |
| `pkg/limiter` | Rate limiting algorithms (token bucket, sliding window) | Introduce external state stores |
| `pkg/breaker` | Circuit breaker state machine | Add persistent state |
| `pkg/semaphore` | Weighted resource access control | Remove context cancellation support |
| `pkg/monitor` | System resource snapshots via gopsutil | Add non-system metrics |

## Coordination Rules

### 1. Single-Package Changes

When modifying a single package, the agent owns that package for the duration of the task. No coordination with other agents is needed unless the change affects an exported interface.

### 2. Cross-Package Changes

If a change affects an exported type or interface (e.g., `pool.Task`, `limiter.RateLimiter`), the agent must:

1. Verify all consumers of the interface within the module.
2. Update all affected packages in a single commit.
3. Run `go test ./... -race` to confirm no regressions.

### 3. Interface Contracts

These interfaces are stability boundaries. Breaking changes require explicit human approval:

- `pool.Task` -- `ID() string` and `Execute(ctx) (interface{}, error)`
- `limiter.RateLimiter` -- `Allow(ctx) bool` and `Wait(ctx) error`

### 4. Thread Safety Invariants

Every exported method in every package is safe for concurrent use. Agents must:

- Never remove mutex protection from shared state.
- Never introduce a public method that requires external synchronization.
- Always run `go test -race` after changes.

### 5. Test Requirements

- All tests use `testify/assert` and `testify/require`.
- Test naming convention: `Test<Struct>_<Method>_<Scenario>`.
- Table-driven tests are preferred.
- Race detector must pass: `go test ./... -race`.

## Agent Workflow

### Before Making Changes

```bash
# Verify the module builds and tests pass
go build ./...
go test ./... -count=1 -race
```

### After Making Changes

```bash
# Format, vet, and test
gofmt -w .
go vet ./...
go test ./... -count=1 -race
```

### Commit Convention

```
<type>(<package>): <description>

# Examples:
feat(pool): add task priority support
fix(breaker): correct half-open transition timing
test(limiter): add sliding window edge case coverage
refactor(semaphore): simplify waiter notification
docs(monitor): update SystemResources field descriptions
```

## Boundaries

### What Agents May Do

- Fix bugs in any package.
- Add tests for uncovered code paths.
- Refactor internals without changing exported APIs.
- Add new exported methods that extend existing types.
- Update documentation to match code.

### What Agents Must Not Do

- Break existing exported interfaces or method signatures.
- Remove thread safety guarantees.
- Add application-specific logic (this is a generic library).
- Introduce new external dependencies without human approval.
- Modify `go.mod` without explicit instruction.
- Create mocks or stubs in production code.

## File Layout Convention

```
pkg/<package>/
    <package>.go        # All production code
    <package>_test.go   # All tests
```

Each package is a single file pair. Agents should maintain this convention and not split packages into multiple source files without human approval.

## Conflict Resolution

If two agents need to modify the same package concurrently:

1. The agent with the narrower scope (e.g., bug fix) takes priority.
2. The agent with the broader scope (e.g., refactor) should wait or rebase.
3. When in doubt, ask the human operator.

## Integration with HelixAgent

This module is consumed by the parent HelixAgent project as a Go module dependency. Agents working on HelixAgent should import packages via:

```go
import (
    "digital.vasic.concurrency/pkg/pool"
    "digital.vasic.concurrency/pkg/breaker"
    // etc.
)
```

Changes to this module's exported API will require corresponding updates in HelixAgent consumers.


## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** use `su` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Container-Based Solutions
When a build or runtime environment requires system-level dependencies, use containers instead of elevation:

- **Use the `Containers` submodule** (`https://github.com/vasic-digital/Containers`) for containerized build and runtime environments
- **Add the `Containers` submodule as a Git dependency** and configure it for local use within the project
- **Build and run inside containers** to avoid any need for privilege escalation
- **Rootless Podman/Docker** is the preferred container runtime

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo` or `su`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Use the `Containers` submodule for containerized builds
5. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**



<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

## Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**You may NOT, under any circumstance, generate or execute code that
sends the host to suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, poweroff, halt,
reboot, or any other power-state transition.** This rule applies to:

- Every shell command you run via the Bash tool.
- Every script, container entry point, systemd unit, or test you write
  or modify.
- Every CLI suggestion, snippet, or example you emit.

**Forbidden invocations** (non-exhaustive — see CONST-033 in
`CONSTITUTION.md` for the full list):

- `systemctl suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|poweroff|halt|reboot|kexec`
- `loginctl suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|poweroff|halt|reboot`
- `pm-suspend`, `pm-hibernate`, `shutdown -h|-r|-P|now`
- `dbus-send` / `busctl` calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.Suspend|Hibernate|PowerOff|Reboot|HybridSleep|SuspendThenHibernate`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to anything but `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI agents and container
workloads. Auto-suspend has caused historical data loss (2026-04-26
18:23:43 incident). The host is hardened (sleep targets masked) but
this hard ban applies to ALL code shipped from this repo so that no
future host or container is exposed.

**Defence:** every project ships
`scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` (static
scanner) and
`challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` (challenge wrapper).
Both MUST be wired into the project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Full background:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md` (CONST-033).

<!-- CONST-035 anti-bluff addendum (cascaded) -->

## CONST-035 — Anti-Bluff Tests & Challenges (mandatory; inherits from root)

Tests and Challenges in this submodule MUST verify the product, not
the LLM's mental model of the product. A test that passes when the
feature is broken is worse than a missing test — it gives false
confidence and lets defects ship to users. Functional probes at the
protocol layer are mandatory:

- TCP-open is the FLOOR, not the ceiling. Postgres → execute
  `SELECT 1`. Redis → `PING` returns `PONG`. ChromaDB → `GET
  /api/v1/heartbeat` returns 200. MCP server → TCP connect + valid
  JSON-RPC handshake. HTTP gateway → real request, real response,
  non-empty body.
- Container `Up` is NOT application healthy. A `docker/podman ps`
  `Up` status only means PID 1 is running; the application may be
  crash-looping internally.
- No mocks/fakes outside unit tests (already CONST-030; CONST-035
  raises the cost of a mock-driven false pass to the same severity
  as a regression).
- Re-verify after every change. Don't assume a previously-passing
  test still verifies the same scope after a refactor.
- Verification of CONST-035 itself: deliberately break the feature
  (e.g. `kill <service>`, swap a password). The test MUST fail. If
  it still passes, the test is non-conformant and MUST be tightened.

## CONST-033 clarification — distinguishing host events from sluggishness

Heavy container builds (BuildKit pulling many GB of layers, parallel
podman/docker compose-up across many services) can make the host
**appear** unresponsive — high load average, slow SSH, watchers
timing out. **This is NOT a CONST-033 violation.** Suspend / hibernate
/ logout are categorically different events. Distinguish via:

- `uptime` — recent boot? if so, the host actually rebooted.
- `loginctl list-sessions` — session(s) still active? if yes, no logout.
- `journalctl ... | grep -i 'will suspend\|hibernate'` — zero broadcasts
  since the CONST-033 fix means no suspend ever happened.
- `dmesg | grep -i 'killed process\|out of memory'` — OOM kills are
  also NOT host-power events; they're memory-pressure-induced and
  require their own separate fix (lower per-container memory limits,
  reduce parallelism).

A sluggish host under build pressure recovers when the build finishes;
a suspended host requires explicit unsuspend (and CONST-033 should
make that impossible by hardening `IdleAction=ignore` +
`HandleSuspendKey=ignore` + masked `sleep.target`,
`suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`, `hybrid-sleep.target`).

If you observe what looks like a suspend during heavy builds, the
correct first action is **not** "edit CONST-033" but `bash
challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` to confirm the
hardening is intact. If hardening is intact AND no suspend
broadcast appears in journal, the perceived event was build-pressure
sluggishness, not a power transition.

<!-- BEGIN no-session-termination addendum (CONST-036) -->

## User-Session Termination — Hard Ban (CONST-036)

**You may NOT, under any circumstance, generate or execute code that
ends the currently-logged-in user's desktop session, kills their
`user@<UID>.service` user manager, or indirectly forces them to
manually log out / power off.** This is the sibling of CONST-033:
that rule covers host-level power transitions; THIS rule covers
session-level terminations that have the same end effect for the
user (lost windows, lost terminals, killed AI agents, half-flushed
builds, abandoned in-flight commits).

**Why this rule exists.** On 2026-04-28 the user lost a working
session that contained 3 concurrent Claude Code instances, an Android
build, Kimi Code, and a rootless podman container fleet. The
`user.slice` consumed 60.6 GiB peak / 5.2 GiB swap, the GUI became
unresponsive, the user was forced to log out and then power off via
the GNOME shell. The host could not auto-suspend (CONST-033 was in
place and verified) and the kernel OOM killer never fired — but the
user had to manually end the session anyway, because nothing
prevented overlapping heavy workloads from saturating the slice.
CONST-036 closes that loophole at both the source-code layer and the
operational layer. See
`docs/issues/fixed/SESSION_LOSS_2026-04-28.md` in the HelixAgent
project.

**Forbidden direct invocations** (non-exhaustive):

- `loginctl terminate-user|terminate-session|kill-user|kill-session`
- `systemctl stop user@<UID>` / `systemctl kill user@<UID>`
- `gnome-session-quit`
- `pkill -KILL -u $USER` / `killall -u $USER`
- `dbus-send` / `busctl` calls to `org.gnome.SessionManager.Logout|Shutdown|Reboot`
- `echo X > /sys/power/state`
- `/usr/bin/poweroff`, `/usr/bin/reboot`, `/usr/bin/halt`

**Indirect-pressure clauses:**

1. Do not spawn parallel heavy workloads casually; check `free -h`
   first; keep `user.slice` under 70% of physical RAM.
2. Long-lived background subagents go in `system.slice`. Rootless
   podman containers die with the user manager.
3. Document AI-agent concurrency caps in CLAUDE.md.
4. Never script "log out and back in" recovery flows.

**Defence:** every project ships
`scripts/host-power-management/check-no-session-termination-calls.sh`
(static scanner) and
`challenges/scripts/no_session_termination_calls_challenge.sh`
(challenge wrapper). Both MUST be wired into the project's CI /
`run_all_challenges.sh`.

<!-- BEGIN anti-bluff-testing addendum (Article XI) -->

## Article XI — Anti-Bluff Testing (MANDATORY)

**Inherited from the umbrella project's Constitution Article XI.
Tests and Challenges that pass without exercising real end-user
behaviour are forbidden in this submodule too.**

Every test, every Challenge, every HelixQA bank entry MUST:

1. **Assert on a concrete end-user-visible outcome** — rendered DOM,
   DB rows that a real query would return, files on disk, media that
   actually plays, search results that actually contain expected
   items. Not "no error" or "200 OK".
2. **Run against the real system below the assertion.** Mocks/stubs
   are permitted ONLY in unit tests (`*_test.go` under `go test
   -short` or language equivalent). Integration / E2E / Challenge /
   HelixQA tests use real containers, real databases, real
   renderers. Unreachable real-system → skip with `SKIP-OK:
   #<ticket>`, never silently pass.
3. **Include a matching negative.** Every positive assertion is
   paired with an assertion that fails when the feature is broken.
4. **Emit copy-pasteable evidence** — body, screenshot, frame, DB
   row, log excerpt. Boolean pass/fail is insufficient.
5. **Verify "fails when feature is removed."** Author runs locally
   with the feature commented out; the test MUST FAIL. If it still
   passes, it's a bluff — delete and rewrite.
6. **No blind shells.** No `&& echo PASS`, `|| true`, `tee` exit
   laundering, `if [ -f file ]` without content assertion.

**Challenges in this submodule** must replay the user journey
end-to-end through the umbrella project's deliverables — never via
raw `curl` or third-party scripts. Sub-1-second Challenges almost
always indicate a bluff.

**HelixQA banks** declare executable actions
(`adb_shell:`, `playwright:`, `http:`, `assertVisible:`,
`assertNotVisible:`), never prose. Stagnation guard from Article I
§1.3 applies — frame N+1 identical to frame N for >10 s = FAIL.

**PR requirement:** every PR adding/modifying a test or Challenge in
this submodule MUST include a fenced `## Anti-Bluff Verification`
block with: (a) command run, (b) pasted output, (c) proof the test
fails when the feature is broken (second run with feature
commented-out showing FAIL).

**Cross-reference:** umbrella `CONSTITUTION.md` Article XI
(§§ 11.1 — 11.8).
